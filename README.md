# WebMovie
WebMovie
This is my first fullStuck app  for final Project with React js for frontend and Spring boot for backend.

1. For run backend you need direct to loction: WebMovie/MyProject/backend/src/main/java/com.myproject.webstoreproject and enter to file (WebStoreProjectAppliction)
and then run "main function" (main configurations) make backend server run.

2. For run fronend you need open terminal in your vscode or IntelliJ and write this commands in terminal ...
1) write in terminal:   cd MyProject
2) write in terminal:   cd frontend
3) now write in terminal:   npm start
if not run react  and not  open your Browser with webSite you need ...
4) write in terminal:   npm install react-scripts --save
5) now write in terminal:   npm start
if all work fine its open your browser and website from frontend

you need sure backend run for see mysql database in website frontend
Enjoy!...
